0,0,"Since Alpha is a trader sending an order to open a position of size 0.3 at time 1, and it is not true that 1 is a time in which the market is closed, and 0.3 is not 0, then the order by the trader Alpha of size 0.3 is accepted at time 1. Since the order by the trader Alpha of size 0.3 is accepted at time 1, and 120 is the price at 1, then the trader Alpha has a position at time 1 of size 0.3 and notional 36.0. Since Alpha is a trader sending an order to close the position at time 9, and 130 is the price at 9, and the trader Alpha has a position at time 1 of size 0.3 and notional 36.0, and 9 is over 1, then the trader Alpha has returns amounting to 3.0, with 3.0 given by 0.3*130-36.0.","Trader Alpha places an order to initiate a trade of magnitude 0.3 at time 1 when the market is open, and since 0.3 is not zero, the order is processed at 1. As a result, Alpha holds a position at 1 with a value of 36.0 (calculated as 0.3 times the price 120 at 1). Later, Alpha issues an order to liquidate this position at time 9 when the price is 130. The returns from this transaction are calculated as 3.0, which is the dsinceference between 0.3 multiplied by 130 and the original notional value 36.0.","profitLoss(Alpha,3.0)","Trader Alpha sends an order to open a position of size 0.3 at time 1, as long as the market is not closed at that time and the size is not zero. Therefore, the order is accepted. The price at time 1 is 120, so Trader Alpha's position at that time is a size of 0.3 with a notional value of 36.0.

Trader Alpha also sends an order to close the position at time 9, with the price at that time being 130. Since Trader Alpha had a position of size 0.3 and notional value 36.0 at time 1, and time 9 comes after time 1, Trader Alpha's returns amount to 3.0. This calculation is derived from the formula 0.3 multiplied by 130, minus 36.0, resulting in a return of 3.0.","The trader Alpha sends an order to open a position of size 0.3 at time 1, which is accepted because the market is not closed at that time. The price at time 1 is 120, so the trader Alpha now has a position of size 0.3 and notional 36.0. Later, at time 9, the trader Alpha sends an order to close the position. The price at that time is 130. Since 9 is after 1, the trader Alpha's returns amount to 3.0, calculated as 0.3 multiplied by 130, minus 36.0."
1,1,"Since Beta is a trader sending an order to open a position of size -0.2 at time 1, and it is not true that 1 is a time in which the market is closed, and -0.2 is not 0, then the order by the trader Beta of size -0.2 is accepted at time 1. Since the order by the trader Beta of size -0.2 is accepted at time 1, and 120 is the price at 1, then the trader Beta has a position at time 1 of size -0.2 and notional -24.0. Since Beta is a trader sending an order to close the position at time 10, and 110 is the price at 10, and the trader Beta has a position at time 1 of size -0.2 and notional -24.0, and 10 is over 1, then the trader Beta has returns amounting to 2.0, with 2.0 given by -0.2*110--24.0.","Trader Beta places an order to initiate a trade of magnitude -0.2 at time 1 when the market is open, and since -0.2 is not zero, the order is processed at 1. As a result, Beta holds a position at 1 with a value of -24.0 (calculated as -0.2 times the price 120 at 1). Later, Beta issues an order to liquidate this position at time 10 when the price is 110. The returns from this transaction are calculated as 2.0, which is the dsinceference between -0.2 multiplied by 110 and the original notional value -24.0.","profitLoss(Beta,2.0)","The trader Beta is a trader who sends an order to open a position with a size of -0.2 at time 1. It is important to note that time 1 is not a time when the market is closed, and the size of -0.2 is not equal to 0. Therefore, the trader Beta's order of size -0.2 is accepted at time 1. Additionally, since the order is accepted at time 1 and the price at that time is 120, the trader Beta now holds a position at time 1 with a size of -0.2 and a notional value of -24.0.

Furthermore, the trader Beta sends an order to close the position at time 10, and the price at that time is 110. Given that the trader Beta has a position at time 1 with a size of -0.2 and a notional value of -24.0, and considering that time 10 is later than time 1, it can be concluded that the trader Beta has returns amounting to 2.0. These returns are calculated using the formula -0.2*110--24.0, which results in a value of 2.0.","Trader Beta sends an order to open a position with a size of -0.2 at time 1. This order is accepted because the market is not closed at that time and the size is not 0. The price at time 1 is 120, so Trader Beta's position at that time is -0.2 with a notional value of -24.0. 

Later, at time 10, Trader Beta sends an order to close the position. The price at that time is 110. Since the position at time 1 is -0.2 with a notional value of -24.0, Trader Beta's returns amount to 2.0. This calculation is given by multiplying the size (-0.2) by the price at time 10 (110) and subtracting the notional value (-24.0)."
